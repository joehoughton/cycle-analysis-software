# Cycle Analysis

### About
Cycle Analysis reads raw .hrm data files from a Polar CS600x cycle computer, providing metrics which allow users to analyse their training.

### Track & Analyse
Uploaded sessions are displayed in calendar view. Graphs are drawn for each session and an area of the graph can be selected, providing users with metrics for this subset of data. 
This allows users to eliminate data recorded outside each workout which often skews final results.

### Advanced Metrics
The software calculates Training Stress Score (TSS), Intensity Factor (IF) and Normalised Power (NP) for each session.

### Interval Detection
An interval is a period of work followed by a period of rest. Intervals are automatically detected and highlighted, along with rest periods, allowing users to visualise the intensity of their workout. 
Intervals can be selected to view a summary of data. Summaries are also provided for combined workout and rest periods, providing more accurate averages for the session.

### Get Started
